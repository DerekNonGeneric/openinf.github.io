This is a tentative homepage for information on OpenINF development.

These pages are intended to collect information useful to OpenINF developers,
including collaborative editing of documents (i.e., it is an alternative to us
having a wiki, but one that is edited entirely via git pushes).

This homepage is maintained by editing files in the
[`openinf/openinf.github.io` repository on GitHub][gh-pages-repo]. It is then
published on the https://openinf.github.io GitHub page.

It is meant to be edited collaboratively like a wiki, except that instead of a
web form, you get to use a text editor and git. What could be better?
